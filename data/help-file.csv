A list of affected proteins is given out!This process is  time intensiv (15 to 30 minutes).You can import your own database. This should be a list coming from the fasta file of your used proteom database (use function read.fasta() from bio3d package). This file should be saved as an object called database in a .Rdata image and put into the folder database of your cRacker destination.For exclusion of redundant peptides based on maxquant results, check additionally ""Use MaxQuant Exclusion (very fast procedure).""",ERLU,expected ratio labeled:unlabeled,"Defines the expected ratio of log2 transformed ratios.

Intensities that lie outside whiskers (1.5 of interquartile range) are defined as outliers. >Outside both whiskers<excludes peptides that are outside of the upper as well the lower whisker. The pool of peptides consists of all peptides of one protein across all replicates or only of a peptide species across replicates if >Scaling across samples< is disabled. >Outside lower whisker<excludes only peptides that are outside the lower whisker.

These lists need to be in a separate folder, which is your working directory. After starting cRacker you first have to select your working directory containing your peptidelists. Additionally you need to choose the used quantitation engine that has been used to create these lists. In case you need to reload a specific parameter combination you can load it from a parameters.Rdata file from a previous cRacker calculation. Consider, that a created experimental design file needs still to be loaded by hand.",
